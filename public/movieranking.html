<h1>The Best Movies According to Inder :) </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time are listed below.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The perks of being a wallflower</h3> 
<p>Shows vulnerability and the importance of mental health and friendships.</p>
<h3>10 things I hate about you</h3>
<p>It is a pretty good romantic teen comedy with an enemies to lovers trope</p>
<h3>Little Women</h3>
<p>Its a story of sisters about stepping into womanhood and going through many
     ups and downs in life and endeavour to make 
    important decisions that can affect their future.</p>
